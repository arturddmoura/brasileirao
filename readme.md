#### Description:
    This project started after taking a few Data Analysis courses, I really took a liking for Python and Data Visualization, 
and thought it would be nice to develop a project to put my skills to the test.
    The project begun with the decision of the data I wanted to use, and I decided to use football stats, because they are
easily available, and it is a subject I like and have enough knowledge about to develop a tool that is useful and interesting.
    My main problem when it comes to design was: Deciding the type of graph I would use, I spent a few days developing a few
different idead, trying to implement bar and scatter graphs, but decided in the end that a histogram would be the easiest way
to visualize the data.
    After that, I decided to add user input, so that this could be used for every team, and all the years found in the database.
This was a very fun project to develop, and I loved seeing the data coming to life in the form of graphs.
